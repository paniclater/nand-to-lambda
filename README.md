# nand-to-lambda

Example code & slides for flatMap Oslo presentation!

This repo has code and discussion for surprising parallels and personal discoveries
I made while studying [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) alongside [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/). Both of these learning resources aim to teach difficult concepts from the foundation up, and I found when material is approached this way universal methodologies and concepts arise!
